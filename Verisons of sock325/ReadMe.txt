	If the server is using my library, and the client is using the library Professor Martin wrote, then the client code needs to be using recv(MAX_SIZE) and not recv(len(line)), otherwises the code is going to break 

	In addition, sometimes when running the programs, if the library Professor Martin wrote is used for either server or client, sometimes it will occasionly fail, run it again and it will work.
